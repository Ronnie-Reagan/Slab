# Slab

Slab is an immediate mode GUI toolkit for the Love 2D framework. This library is designed to allow users to easily add user interfaces to their Love 2D projects and quickly create tools for rapid iteration. It is completely written in Lua and relies only on the Love 2D API.

Full documentation has moved to the [docs](docs/index.md) directory. The docs contain a quick start guide and additional examples.
