# Slab Documentation

Welcome to the Slab documentation site. This site provides an overview of the project, a quick start guide and links to examples.

## Overview
Slab is an immediate mode GUI toolkit for the Love 2D framework written entirely in Lua. It allows you to quickly build tools and interfaces for your Love 2D projects without the need for compiled binaries.

## Quick Start
See [quick_start.md](quick_start.md) for a minimal example of integrating Slab into a project. The examples directory also contains ready-to-run demos.

## Examples
Check out the example usage in [SlabTest.lua](../SlabTest.lua) and the small demo in [main.lua](../main.lua).
